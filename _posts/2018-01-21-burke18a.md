title: Balanced Neighborhoods for Multi-sided Fairness in Recommendation
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Fairness has emerged as an important category of analysis for machine learning
  systems in some application areas. In extending the concept of fairness to recommender
  systems, there is an essential tension between the goals of fairness and those of
  personalization. However, there are contexts in which  equity across recommendation
  outcomes is a desirable goal. It is also the case that in some applications fairness
  may be a multisided concept, in which the impacts on multiple groups of individuals
  must be considered. In this paper, we examine two different cases of fairness-aware
  recommender systems: consumer-centered and provider-centered. We  explore the concept
  of a balanced neighborhood as a mechanism to preserve personalization in recommendation
  while enhancing the fairness of recommendation outcomes. We show that a modified
  version of the Sparse Linear Method (SLIM) can be used to improve the balance of
  user and item neighborhoods, with the result of achieving greater outcome fairness
  in real-world datasets with minimal loss in ranking performance.'

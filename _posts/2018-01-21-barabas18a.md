title: 'Interventions over Predictions: Reframing the Ethical Debate for Actuarial
  Risk Assessment'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Actuarial risk assessments are frequently touted as a neutral way to counteract
  implicit bias and increase the fairness of decisions made at almost every juncture
  of the criminal justice system, from pretrial release to sentencing, parole and
  probation. In recent times these assessments have come under increased scrutiny,
  as critics claim that the statistical techniques underlying them might reproduce
  existing patterns of discrimination and historical biases that are reflected in
  the data. Much of this debate is centered around competing notions of fairness and
  predictive accuracy, which seek to problematize the use of variables that act as
  “proxies” for protected classes, such as race and gender. However, these debates
  fail to address the core ethical issue at hand - that current risk assessments are
  ill-equipped to support ethical punishment and rehabilitation practices in the criminal
  justice system, because they offer only a limited insight into the underlying drivers
  of criminal behavior. In this paper, we examine the prevailing paradigms of fairness
  currently under debate and propose an alternative methodology for identifying the
  underlying social and structural factors that drive criminal behavior. We argue
  that the core ethical debate surrounding the use of regression in risk assessments
  is not one of bias or accuracy. Rather, it’s one of purpose. If machine learning
  is operationalized merely in the service of predicting future crime, then it becomes
  difficult to break cycles of criminalization that are driven by the iatrogenic effects
  of the criminal justice system itself. We posit that machine learning should not
  be used for prediction, rather it should be used to surface covariates that are
  fed into a causal model for understanding the social, structural and psychological
  drivers of crime. We propose an alternative application of machine learning and
  causal inference away from predicting risk scores to risk mitigation.

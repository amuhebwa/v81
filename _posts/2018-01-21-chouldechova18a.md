title: A case study of algorithm-assisted decision making in child maltreatment hotline
  screening decisions
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Every year there are more than 3.6 million referrals made to child protection
  agencies across the US. The practice of screening calls is left to each jurisdiction
  to follow local practices and policies, potentially leading to large variation in
  the way in which referrals are treated across the country. Whilst increasing access
  to linked administrative data is available, it is difficult for welfare workers
  to make systematic use of historical information about all the children and adults
  on a single referral call. Risk prediction models that use routinely collected administrative
  data can help call workers to better identify cases that are likely to result in
  adverse outcomes. However, the use of predictive analytics in the area of child
  welfare is contentious. There is a possibility that some communities—such as those
  in poverty or from particular racial and ethnic groups—will be disadvantaged by
  the reliance on government administrative data. On the other hand, these analytics
  tools can augment or replace human judgments, which themselves are biased and imperfect.
  In this paper we describe our work on developing, validating, fairness auditing,
  and deploying a risk prediction model in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA. We
  discuss the results of our analysis to-date, and also highlight key problems and
  data bias issues that present challenges for model evaluation and deployment.

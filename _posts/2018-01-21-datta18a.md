title: 'Discrimination in Online Personalization: A Multidisciplinary Inquiry'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: We explore ways in which discrimination may arise in the targeting of job-related
  advertising, noting the potential for multiple parties to contribute to its occurrence.  We
  then examine the statutes and case law interpreting the prohibition on advertisements
  that indicate a preference based on protected class, and consider its application
  to online advertising.  We focus on its interaction with Section 230 of the Communications
  Decency Act, which provides interactive computer services with immunity for providing
  access to  information created by a third party.  We argue that such services can
  lose that immunity if they target ads toward or away from protected classes without
  explicit instructions from advertisers to do so.

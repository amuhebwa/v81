title: 'All The Cool Kids, How Do They Fit In?: Popularity and Demographic Biases
  in Recommender Evaluation and Effectiveness'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: In the research literature, evaluations of recommender system effectiveness
  typically report results over a given data set, providing an aggregate measure of
  effectiveness over each instance (e.g. user) in the data set. Recent advances in
  information retrieval evaluation, however, demonstrate the importance of considering
  the distribution of effectiveness across diverse groups of varying sizes. For example,
  do users of different ages or genders obtain similar utility from the system, particularly
  if their group is a relatively small subset of the user base? We apply this consideration
  to recommender systems, using offline evaluation and a utility-based metric of recommendation
  effectiveness to explore whether different user demographic groups experience similar
  recommendation accuracy. We find demographic differences in measured recommender
  effectiveness across two data sets containing different types of feedback in different
  domains; these differences sometimes, but not always, correlate with the size of
  the user group in question. Demographic effects also have a complex—and likely detrimental—interaction
  with popularity bias, a known deficiency of recommender evaluation. These results
  demonstrate the need for recommender system evaluation protocols that explicitly
  quantify the degree to which the system is meeting the information needs of all
  its users, as well as the need for researchers and operators to move beyond naïve
  evaluations that favor the needs of larger subsets of the user population while
  ignoring smaller subsets.

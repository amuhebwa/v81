title: "“Meaningful Information” and the Right to Explanation"
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: There is no single, neat statutory provision labeled the “right to explanation”
  in Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). But nor is such a right
  illusory. Responding to two prominent papers that, in turn, conjure and critique
  the right to explanation in the context of automated decision-making, we advocate
  a return to the text of the GDPR. Articles 13–15 provide rights to “meaningful information
  about the logic involved” in automated decisions. This is a right to explanation,
  whether one uses the phrase or not. The right to explanation should be interpreted
  functionally, flexibly, and should, at a minimum, enable a data subject to exercise
  his or her rights under the GDPR and human rights law.

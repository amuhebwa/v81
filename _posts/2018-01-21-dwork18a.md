title: Decoupled Classifiers for Group-Fair and Efficient Machine Learning
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: When it is ethical and legal to use a sensitive attribute (such as gender
  or race) in machine learning systems, the question remains how to do so. We show
  that the naive application of machine learning algorithms using sensitive attributes
  leads to an inherent tradeoff in accuracy between groups. We provide a simple and
  efficient decoupling technique, that can be added on top of any black-box machine
  learning algorithm, to learn different classifiers for different groups. Transfer
  learning is used to mitigate the problem of having too little data on any one group.

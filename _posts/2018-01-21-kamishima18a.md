title: Recommendation Independence
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: This paper studies a recommendation algorithm whose outcomes are not influenced
  by specified information. It is useful in contexts potentially unfair decision should
  be avoided, such as job-applicant recommendations that are not influenced by socially
  sensitive information. An algorithm that could exclude the influence of sensitive
  information would thus be useful for job-matching with fairness. We call the condition
  between a recommendation outcome and a sensitive feature Recommendation Independence,
  which is formally defined as statistical independence between the outcome and the
  feature. Our previous independence-enhanced algorithms simply matched the means
  of predictions between sub-datasets consisting of the same sensitive value. However,
  this approach could not remove the sensitive information represented by the second
  or higher moments of distributions. In this paper, we develop new methods that can
  deal with the second moment, i.e., variance, of recommendation outcomes without
  increasing the computational complexity. These methods can more strictly remove
  the sensitive information, and experimental results demonstrate that our new algorithms
  can more effectively eliminate the factors that undermine fairness. Additionally,
  we explore potential applications for independence-enhanced recommendation, and
  discuss its relation to other concepts, such as recommendation diversity.

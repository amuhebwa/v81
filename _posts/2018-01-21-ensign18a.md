title: Runaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Predictive policing systems are increasingly used to determine how to allocate
  police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime data (e.g.,
  arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process is repeated. Such
  systems have been shown susceptible to runaway feedback loops, where police are
  repeatedly sent back to the same neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.  In
  response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that proves why
  this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits such problems,
  and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive policing system (in a black-box
  manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not occur, allowing the true crime rate
  to be learned.   Our results are quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model)
  between the degree to which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in
  crime rates between areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which reported
  incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and discovered incidents of crime
  (i.e those directly observed by police officers dispatched as a result of the predictive
  policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while reported incidents can attenuate the
  degree of runaway feedback, they cannot entirely remove it without the interventions
  we suggest.'

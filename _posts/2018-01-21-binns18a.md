title: 'Fairness in Machine Learning: Lessons from Political Philosophy'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: What does it mean for a machine learning model to be ‘fair’, in terms which
  can be operationalised? Should fairness consist of ensuring everyone has an equal
  probability of obtaining some benefit, or should we aim instead to minimise the
  harms to the least advantaged? Can the relevant ideal be determined by reference
  to some alternative state of affairs in which a particular social pattern of discrimination
  does not exist? Various definitions proposed in recent literature make different
  assumptions about what terms like discrimination and fairness mean and how they
  can be defined in mathematical terms. Questions of discrimination, egalitarianism
  and justice are of significant interest to moral and political philosophers, who
  have expended significant efforts in formalising and defending these central concepts.
  It is therefore unsurprising that attempts to formalise ‘fairness’ in machine learning
  contain echoes of these old philosophical debates. This paper draws on existing
  work in moral and political philosophy in order to elucidate emerging debates about
  fair machine learning.

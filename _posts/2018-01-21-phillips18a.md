title: Interpretable Active Learning
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Active learning has long been a topic of study in machine learning. However,
  as increasingly complex and opaque models have become standard practice, the process
  of active learning, too, has become more opaque. There has been little investigation
  into interpreting what specific trends and patterns an active learning strategy
  may be exploring. This work expands on the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
  framework (LIME) to provide explanations for active learning recommendations. We
  demonstrate how LIME can be used to generate locally faithful explanations for an
  active learning strategy, and how these explanations can be used to understand how
  different models and datasets explore a problem space over time. These explanations
  can also be used to generate batches based on common sources of uncertainty. These
  regions of common uncertainty can be useful for understanding a model’s current
  weaknesses.  In order to quantify the per-subgroup differences in how an active
  learning strategy queries spatial regions, we introduce a notion of uncertainty
  bias (based on disparate impact) to measure the discrepancy in the confidence for
  a model’s predictions between one subgroup and another.  Using the uncertainty bias
  measure, we show that our query explanations accurately reflect the subgroup focus
  of the active learning queries, allowing for an interpretable explanation of what
  is being learned as points with similar sources of uncertainty have their uncertainty
  bias resolved. We demonstrate that this technique can be applied to track uncertainty
  bias over user-defined clusters or automatically generated clusters based on the
  source of uncertainty. We also measure how the choice of initial labeled examples
  effects groups over time.

title: Mixed Messages? The Limits of Automated Social Media Content Analysis
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Governments and companies are turning to automated tools to make sense of
  what people post on social media. Policymakers routinely call for social media companies
  to identify and take down hate speech, terrorist propaganda, harassment, “fake news”
  or disinformation. Other policy proposals have focused on mining social media to
  inform law enforcement and immigration decisions. But these proposals wrongly assume
  that automated technology can accomplish on a large scale the kind of nuanced analysis
  that humans can do on a small scale. Today’s tools for analyzing social media text
  have limited ability to parse the meaning of human communication or detect the intent
  of the speaker.  A knowledge gap exists between data scientists studying natural
  language processing (NLP) and policymakers advocating for wide adoption of automated
  social media analysis and moderation. Policymakers must understand the capabilities
  and limits of NLP before endorsing or adopting automated content analysis tools,
  particularly for making decisions that affect fundamental rights or access to government
  benefits. Without proper safeguards, these tools can facilitate overbroad censorship
  and biased enforcement of laws or terms of service.  This paper draws on existing
  research to explain the capabilities and limitations of text classifiers for social
  media posts and other online content. It is aimed at helping researchers and technical
  experts address the gaps in policymakers’ knowledge about what is possible with
  automated text analysis.

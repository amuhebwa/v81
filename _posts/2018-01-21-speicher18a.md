title: Potential for Discrimination in Online Targeted Advertising
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Recently, online targeted advertising platforms like Facebook have been
  criticized for allowing advertisers to discriminate against users belonging to sensitive
  groups, i.e., to exclude users belonging to a certain race or gender from receiving
  their ads. Such criticisms have led, for instance, Facebook to disallow the use
  of attributes such as ethnic affinity from being used by advertisers when targeting
  ads related to housing or employment or financial services. In this paper, we show
  that such measures are far from sufficient and that the problem of discrimination
  in targeted advertising is much more pernicious.  We argue that discrimination measures
  should be based on the targeted population and not on the attributes used for targeting.
  We systematically investigate the different targeting methods offered by Facebook
  for their ability to enable discriminatory advertising.  We show that a malicious
  advertiser can create highly discriminatory ads without using sensitive attributes.
  Our findings call for exploring fundamentally new methods for mitigating discrimination
  in online targeted advertising.

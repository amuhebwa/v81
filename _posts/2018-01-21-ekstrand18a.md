title: 'Privacy for All: Ensuring Fair and Equitable Privacy Protections'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: In this position paper, we argue for applying recent research on ensuring
  sociotechnical systems are fair and non-discriminatory to the privacy protections
  those systems may provide. Privacy literature seldom considers whether a proposed
  privacy scheme protects all persons uniformly, irrespective of membership in protected
  classes or particular risk in the face of privacy failure. Just as algorithmic decision-making
  systems may have discriminatory outcomes even without explicit or deliberate discrimination,
  so also privacy regimes may disproportionately fail to protect vulnerable members
  of their target population, resulting in disparate impact with respect to the effectiveness
  of privacy protections.We propose a research agenda that will illuminate this issue,
  along with related issues in the intersection of fairness and privacy, and present
  case studies that show how the outcomes of this research may change existing privacy
  and fairness research. We believe it is important to ensure that technologies and
  policies intended to protect the users and subjects of information systems provide
  such protection in an equitable fashion.
